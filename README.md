# Sizing and Scheduling Solar Photovoltaic Battery System For Demand Peak Shaving (15-minute monthly demand peak)
   
   
**Note**: Should you face an issue running the codes, please feel free to drop me an E-mail (hssharadga@tamu.edu) or LinkedIn message (Hussein Sharadga).
    
   
You need to install and import CVX library to your MATLAB (http://cvxr.com/), obtain the licenses (http://cvxr.com/cvx/licensing/) and  obtain the licenses for MOSEK solver.
   
Please support my reserch by cite the following related papers:

# General Info   
- To procede, find "main" MATLAB code.
   
# Info: Sizing Paper


- Approach #2 was used to generate the results of the sizing paper.
- Approach #1 is very slow for some scenarios in which a lot of binary vectors needs to be optimized.
- Approach #2 has the full notation and throughly explained, so please start with Approach #2.
- Approach #1, scenario #3 with eta<>1: The formulation was not explained for the sake of brevity in the Sizing paper. The full explanation is now drafted in word files and uploaded in Approach #1 Folder> Sizes-are-given Folder.
- Approach #1, "main" script notice that J=1 One-year simulation, J=2 One-day simulation
