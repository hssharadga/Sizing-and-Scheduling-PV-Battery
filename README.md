**Note**: Should you face an issue running the codes, please feel free to drop me an E-mail (hssharadga@tamu.edu) or LinkedIn message (Hussein Sharadga).
    
   
You need to install and import CVX library to your MATLAB (http://cvxr.com/), obtain the licenses (http://cvxr.com/cvx/licensing/) and  obtain the licenses for MOSEK solver.

# General Info   
- To procede, find "Main" MATLAB code.
   
# Info: Sizing Paper


- Approach #2 was used to generate the results of the sizing paper.
- Approach #1 is very slow for some scenarios in which a lot of binary vectors needs to be optimized.
- Approach #2 has the full notation and throughly explained, so please start with Approach #2.
- Approach #1, scenario #3 with eta<>1: The formulation was not explained for the sake of brevity in the Sizing paper. The full explanation is now drafted in word files and uploaded in Approach #1 Folder> Sizes-are-given Folder.
- Approach #1, "Main" script notice that J=1 for One-year simulation, J=2 for One-day simulation.
- There are two ways to find the maximum power (MPP) generated by solar PV sysyem:
   A) Sandia's (sandia national laboratories) model as explained in Pmax 4 function. 
   B) Searching algorithm as shown in Other Folder> Maximum-Power-Point-Estimation-PV.
