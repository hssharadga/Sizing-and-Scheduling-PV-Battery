# General Info   
- To procede, find "main" MATLAB code.
   
# Info: Sizing Paper


- Approach #2 was used to generate the results of the sizing paper.
- Approach #1 is very slow for some scenarios in which a lot of binary vector needs to be optimized.
- Approach #1, scenario #3 with eta<>1: The formulation was not explained for the sake of brevity in the Sizing paper. The full explanation is now drafted in word files and uploaded in Approach #1 Folder.
